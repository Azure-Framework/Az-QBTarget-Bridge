Az-QBTarget-Bridge is an Az-Framework compatibility bridge. It provides the expected resource name and API surface for resources written around QBCore, qb-inventory, qb-target, ESX, or ND_Core.

<summary>Bridge and export notes</summary>

Use Az-Framework exports for framework-facing logic:

``lua
local Az = exports['Az-Framework']:GetObject()
local player = exports['Az-Framework']:GetPlayer(source)
local snapshot = exports['Az-Framework']:GetBridgePlayerSnapshot(source)
``

Bridge resources from KSRP-Core are published as Az-Framework compatibility bridges and should be started before legacy resources that expect those framework names.
